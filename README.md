# CS-Petty-Colloquium

About me:

I am a computer science student at ODU and I first learned programming in C++ my freshman year.
I also like to write code in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have worked with full stack 
development of a few projects with my peers. When I am not busy I enjoy playing soccer, rock climbing,
playing video games, or hanging out with my friends.

About my profile:

This is a compilation of work and practice over the years leading to my bachelor's degree.
I have completed projects in a number of computer languages, and committed for both front end
and back end work.
